Ans: Executing multiple tasks at the same time.There are two types of multi-tasking  
1. process based multi-tasking
   --Each task is an indepentent program/process.(Each task can be consider as individual softwares)  
   --Used in OS Level  
2. Thread based multi-tasking  
   --Each task is an independent thread(Separate part of program)  
   --Used in programmatic level  
     (Consider VS code as a program. Then linkter is a thread, Syntax highliter is another thread, Error highliter another thread)
